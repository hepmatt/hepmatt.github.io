            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Matt Lynn, and my military callsign is GANDHI. I am currently a Master Seargent in the California Air National Guard serving as a Career Enlisted Aviator on the MQ-9. I have spent the majority of my career providing classroom and individual instruction to new crew members on the MQ-9. I currently live in Southern California and have a wife with 3 kids and an <a href="dog.jpg">Aussie Doodle</a> dog as well. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My educational background, I have my associate degree from the Community College of the Air Force for Air and Space Technology, and I am currently 16 credits away from attaining my bachelor of science degree in Computer Science from Southwestern College. I have also graduated with Academic Achievement and Distinguished Graduate awards from the Advanced Instructor Course at the USAF Weapons School.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always want to keep learning in this rapidly evolving career field employing artificial intelligence to increase the aviation warfighters' capabilities. I would like to continue to pursue a career in increasing the USâ€™s capabilities in the air, space, and cyberspace domains. I have an emphasis on RADAR sensor employment, Datalink information sharing, and multispectral targeting systems.</p>
